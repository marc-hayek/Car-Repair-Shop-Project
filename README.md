Car-Repair-Shop-Project
=======================

A car repair reservation service project written in c++ for my data structures and algorithms course


Description
------------

For my Data Structures and Algorithms Course final project, we were assigned to develop a simple reservation system, through which customers can request and schedule the maintenance or repair of their cars. The repair shop provides the types of repair that are included in the Services Excel file, and can fix cars of a variety of types, as listed in the Cars Excel file.
The program will take a preset list of customers, and generate requests for services for their specific car model. The program will then output these 
requests onto the screen as follows:

*	Customer first name   Customer last name
*	Customer address
*	Car make, model, year, color
*	Service 1, service 2, … (up to 5 services)
*	Cost of repairs for this car

*	Customer first name   Customer last name
*	Customer address
*	Car make, model, year, color
*	Service 1, service 2, … (up to 5 services)
*	Cost of repairs for this car

etc.

Additionally, the user has the option to see the following options:

1.	Car make that is repaired the most (repeats most frequently)
2.	Car make that got the highest average number of service requests
3.	Total Revenue

All of the project instructions, along with the given excel sheets are included.
