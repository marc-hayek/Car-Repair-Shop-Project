Car-Repair-Shop-Project
=======================

A car repair reservation service project written in c++ for my data structures and algorithms course


Description
------------

For my Data Structures and Algorithms Course final project, we were assigned to develop a simple reservation system, through which customers can request and schedule the maintenance or repair of their cars. The repair shop provides the types of repair that are included in the Services Excel file, and can fix cars of a variety of types, as listed in the Cars Excel file.
The program will take a preset list of customers, and generate requests for services for their specific car model. The program will then output these 
requests onto the screen as follows:

Customer first name   Customer last name
Customer address
Car make, model, year, color
Service 1, service 2, … (up to 5 services)
Cost of repairs for this car
